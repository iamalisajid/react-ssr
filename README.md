# React Server Side Rendering
A baseline for server side rendering for your React application. This repo has a couple of tags that follow building full support for rendering React applications on the server.

## Getting started
Clone the repo with
```git clone https://github.com/iamalisajid/react-ssr```

Install dependencies with
